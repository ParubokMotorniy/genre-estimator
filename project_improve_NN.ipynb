Hello , Mr . Gein ? ) Listen to their hallowed screams ( Mr . Gein ? ) The dead have taken my soul ( let me out of here , Mr. Gein ) Temptation 's lost all control ( Mr. Gein ? I do n't want to play anymore , Mr. Gein ) Dance with the dead in my dreams ( Mr. Gein , this is n't fun anymore ) Listen to their hallowed screams ( I do n't wan na play anymore , Mr. Gein , Mr .
